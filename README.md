# S-plus-Mobile-Network
***This is work in progress - Full sources and documentation not yet available to public***

*S+ Mobile Network Architecture* is the evolution of the current mobile network architecture using *Software Defined Networking (SDN)* in *Virtualization Context*. This is a functional validation setup to show the working of *S+ Mobile Network Architecture* for application oriented forwarding of IP traffic through the use of distributed IP anchors by selection of the right one to use in the following cases.

1. *The MU acts as a server and requires a static IP address for incoming IP flows. Static anchoring at the initial router will be required.*

2. *No fixed IP address, i.e. the MU acts as client, but IP session continuity: No static anchoring at the Initial router will be required.*

3. *No fixed IP address and no IP session continuity; no static anchoring at the Initial router will be required.*
